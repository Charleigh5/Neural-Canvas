# STUDIO.OS | AI OPERATIONAL PROTOCOLS

## 1. CORE DIRECTIVE
Locate the file that is in charge of the function behind the highlight reel when you click it to initialize the sequence. Make sure that is connected to its appropriate file and parent files and all the way through to the landing page because it gets stuck on the initializing sequence when trying to generate the movie reel.

## 2. IMPLEMENTATION STANDARDS
*   **Best Practices:** Use verified documents and React/TypeScript standards.
*   **Task Lists:** Create a task list for every file, function, feature, or part of the application that represents a change.
*   **Breakdown:** detailed step-by-step breakdown of complex tasks into subtasks.
*   **Depth:** Maintain the depth of these instructions for all inputs to prevent repetition.

## 3. ARCHITECTURAL RULES
*   **Structure:** Current directory is root. No nested `src/` prefix in file paths.
*   **Styling:** Tailwind CSS for all styling. Aesthetic is paramount ("Look Amazing").
*   **State:** Zustand for global state.
*   **Animation:** Framer Motion for transitions.
*   **AI:** Use `@google/genai` exclusively. adhere to strict API guidelines (no `GoogleGenerativeAI` import).

## 4. EXECUTION PROCESS
1.  **Analyze:** Determine if it's a request to change the app.
2.  **Specify:** Create a design specification (updates, behavior, visuals).
3.  **Code:** Output XML block with ALL necessary file changes.
